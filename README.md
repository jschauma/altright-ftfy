"Alt-Right" FTFY
================

Hello, media!  I noticed that you have been using the
term "alt-right" lately, for example to describe
president-elect Trump's choice of (Stephen K.
Bannon)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Bannon]
as "chief strategist and senior counselor to the
president".

Not everybody understand what "alt-right" means,
however.  To quote from
(Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right],
it:

> has also been associated with white supremacism,
> Islamophobia, antifeminism, homophobia,
> antisemitism, ethno-nationalism, right-wing
> populism, nativism, traditionalism, and the
> neoreactionary movement.

Now this is a mouthful, and I can see why you can't
easily write "Trump picks white supremacist,
islamophobist, antifeminist, homophobic, antisemitic,
ethno-nationalistic, right-wing populist, nativist,
traditionailist, and neoreactionary leader to one of
the most influential positions in the country."

But "alt-right" really doesn't quite do this justice,
does it?  So let's compromise, let's just use "white
supremacist", because that nicely includes the entire
basket of deplorable adjectives already.

Instead of using "alt-right", say "white supremacist".
It's easy!  Just install this Chrome extension:

- clone this directory
- open chrome://extensions/
- enable 'developer mode'
- select 'Load unpacked extension...'
- select this directory

Et voil√†!
