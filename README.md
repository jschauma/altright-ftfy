"Alt-Right" FTFY
================

Hello, media!  I noticed that you have been using the
term "_alt-right_" lately, for example to describe
president-elect Trump's choice of [Stephen K.
Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Bannon)
as "chief strategist and senior counselor to the
president".

Not everybody understand what "_alt-right_" means,
however.  To quote from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right),
it:

> has also been associated with white supremacism,
> Islamophobia, antifeminism, homophobia,
> antisemitism, ethno-nationalism, right-wing
> populism, nativism, traditionalism, and the
> neoreactionary movement.

Now this is a mouthful, and I can see why you can't
easily write "_Trump picks white supremacist,
islamophobist, antifeminist, homophobic, antisemitic,
ethno-nationalistic, right-wing populist, nativist,
traditionailist, and neoreactionary leader to one of
the most influential positions in the country._"

But "_alt-right_" really doesn't quite do this justice,
does it?  So let's compromise, let's just use "white
supremacist", because that nicely includes the entire
basket of deplorable adjectives already.

Instead of using "_alt-right_", say "_white supremacist_".
It's easy!  Just install this Chrome extension:

- clone this directory
- open chrome://extensions/
- enable 'developer mode'
- select 'Load unpacked extension...'
- select this directory

Et voil√†!
